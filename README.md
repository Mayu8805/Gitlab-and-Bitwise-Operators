# Project Title:

Major Assignment 1 – GitLab and Bitwise Operators


# Brief Description:

1. "major1.h": headerfile for the project containing include directives and prototypes

2. "major1.c": main program file that implements a menu-driven interface for selecting and executing bitwise operations on user-provided integers.

3. "clz.c": implements the Count Leading Zeros function that counts consecutive zero bits from the most significant bit position using bitwise operators.

4. "endian.c": swaps the enidan-ness of a 32-bit input argument

5. "rotate.c": rotates according to the two numbers that are inputted, the first number passed is the number to be rotated
and the second number is the number of positions that the first operand must be rotated by

6. "parity.c": checks whether the number of 1s in the binary form of a number is even (result = 0) or odd (result = 1).
